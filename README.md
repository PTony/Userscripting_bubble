Userscripting_bubble
====================

A mindmap about userscripting.
The goal is to provide an helpful and global view of the differents projects of the userscripting community.


How to use ?
============
* **If you just want to visualize the mindmap:**
  The fastest way is probably to use the java applet. But actually **some browsers have java plugin disabled by default for security reason**.
  If you dont fear, you can **temporary allow java** plugin and allow the mindmap viewer applet when visiting http://ptony.github.io/Userscripting_bubble/

* **If you prefer a safer way or want to edit the mindmap:**
  You can download the mindmap [userscripting_bubble.mm](http://ptony.github.io/Userscripting_bubble/userscripting_bubble.mm) and open it with [Freeplane](http://freeplane.sourceforge.net)
